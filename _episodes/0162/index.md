## New Setup
* Some people were experiencing choppy video. OBS on the streaming device was complaining that encoding was overloaded.
  - Perhaps don’t record while streaming
  - Perhaps use a more powerful machine for streaming
* Can’t hear sound effects. Maybe run wacky-morning-dj on streaming device, and then have headset connected to it
* Building is still a pain. :(
  - Don’t run backups in the background!!!
