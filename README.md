# The Joy of Coding: Episode Guide

The Joy of Coding is a livehacking stream that I do weekly on Wednesday's at 1PM ET.

You can find all of the past episodes here on [Air Mozilla](https://air.mozilla.org/channels/livehacking/) or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmaFLMwlbk8wKMvfEEzp9Hfdlid8VYpL5). You should also pay attention to [the WatchPeopleCode subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/WatchPeopleCode), since that's where I post links for the streams.

One of my viewers had the brilliant idea of making it possible to have an episode guide to accompany and complement the "agenda" that I normally lay out beforehand.

So that's what this is! Still early days, but hopefully we can make this thing work properly. Or it'll fail miserably, who knows? No plan survives breakfast.
